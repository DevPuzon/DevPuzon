### Hi there, I'm [Michael Puzon](https://github.com/DevPuzon) ðŸ‘‹

As a full-stack developer, I have a passion for using technology to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field.

In my current role, I work 18 hours every week day, demonstrating my dedication and commitment to my work. At the same time, I make sure to prioritize my personal life and spend time with my family on the weekends, which helps me maintain a healthy balance between my professional and personal responsibilities.

My skills and abilities have been recognized in several local and international hackathon competitions, where I have earned three wins. These experiences have helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work well under pressure, qualities that have served me well in my career as a full-stack developer.

Overall, I am confident in my ability to be a valuable asset to any team or project, and I am excited to bring my skills and experience to new challenges and opportunities.
